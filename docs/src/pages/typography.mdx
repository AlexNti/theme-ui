# Typography

This page uses themes from Typography.js to populate the `theme.styles` object.
It's not currently a 1:1 replacement for all styles provided by Typography.js,
but is a demonstration of how it could fit in with the rest of Theme UI for users who
want to take advantage of Typography.js.
Typography style themes that are completely decoupled from Typography.js could also be supported in a similar way.

## Usage

```js
import React from 'react'
import { ThemeProvider } from 'theme-ui'
import createTypography from 'theme-ui-typography'
import wp2016 from 'typography-theme-wordpress-2016'

const typography = createTypography(wp2016)
const theme = {
  styles: typography.styles,
}

export default props =>
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
    {props.children}
  </ThemeProvider>
```
