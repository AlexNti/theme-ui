# Layout Components

```js
import {
  Layout,
  Header,
  Main,
  Container,
  Footer
} from 'theme-ui'
```

```jsx
// example composition
<Layout>
  <Header />
  <Main>
    <Sidebar />
    <Container>
      {props.children}
    </Container>
  </Main>
  <Footer />
</Layout>
```

- `Layout` ~~`Page`~~ (name TBD) the root styled component for wrapping other layout components
- `Header` section for top of the page
- `Main` the center of the page
- `Container` a max-width, centered area
- `Footer` section for the bottom of the page
- `Sidebar` (not yet implemented) a sidebar with, ideally, a mechanism for responsive layouts

## Box

A lower-level `Box` primitive component is included as well.
This is similar to the [Rebass Box](https://rebassjs.org/Box) component, but built with Emotion and `@styled-system/css`

```js
import { Box } from 'theme-ui'
```

## Layout Theming

<Note>
  This is a proposal and not yet implemented
</Note>

These page-level layout components could have corresponding themeable aspects,
where an end user could customize styles without having to create custom components.

For example, a `theme` object could have keys in the `theme.styles` object:

```js
// example only
theme: {
  styles: {
    Header: {
      color: 'tomato',
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, only certain properties could be exposed. E.g. within the `theme.colors` object.

```js
// example only
theme: {
  colors: {
    ...otherColors,
    header: {
      text: 'tomato',
      background: 'black',
      link: 'white',
    }
  }
}
```
