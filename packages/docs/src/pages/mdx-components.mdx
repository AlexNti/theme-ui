# MDX Components

To provide custom components to MDX context, but still apply styles from your theme, pass an object of custom components to the `ThemeProvider` component.
For a list of keys that can be used in the `components` object, see the [MDX docs for components](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/#table-of-components).

**Note:** If you do not need to reuse theme styles in your application, the [official `MDXProvider` component](https://mdxjs.com/advanced/components#mdxprovider) can be used instead.

```jsx
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx, ThemeProvider } from 'theme-ui'
import theme from './theme'
import components from './components'

export default props => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme} components={components}>
    {props.children}
  </ThemeProvider>
)
```
