# Layout Components

Primitive page layout components **could be** provided by this library as well.

```jsx
// example
<Layout>
  <Header />
  <Main>
    <Sidebar />
    <Container>
      {props.children}
    </Container>
  </Main>
  <Footer />
</Layout>
```

Lower-level primitives like `Box` and `Flex` components could also be added.

These page-level layout components could have corresponding themeable aspects,
where an end user could customize styles without having to create custom components.

For example, a `theme` object could have keys in the `theme.styles` object:

```js
// example only
theme: {
  styles: {
    Header: {
      color: 'tomato',
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, only certain properties could be exposed. E.g. within the `theme.colors` object.

```js
// example only
theme: {
  colors: {
    ...otherColors,
    header: {
      text: 'tomato',
      background: 'black',
      link: 'white',
    }
  }
}
```
