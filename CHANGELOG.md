## v0.2.0 2019-06-24

- Replaced `lodash.merge` with `deepmerge`
- Updated to use smaller Styled System v5 packages
- Removed layout and flexbox style props from `Box` and layout components
- Renamed `css` prop in experimental custom pragma to `sx` to avoid collisions with Emotion and other libraries
- Refactored `ThemeProvider`
- Removed `toStyle` API from Typography.js package
- Renamed Typography.js package to `@theme-ui/typography`
- Removed `@emotion/styled` dependency - layout components are no longer created with `styled` so passing non-HTML attributes to the component will result in React rendering those props to the DOM
- Removed legacy `ColorModeProvider` and `ComponentProvider` exports
